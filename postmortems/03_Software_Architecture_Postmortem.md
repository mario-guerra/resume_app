# Post-Mortem: Chat History and Development Process

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive post-mortem of the chat-based development process for the Job Application Tracker project. It includes all user prompts verbatim and a summary of the assistant's responses to each, capturing the workflow, decisions, and deliverables for posterity.

## User Prompts and Assistant Responses

---

### 1. User Prompt

```
You are a senior software architect. Carefully review the API specification document I'm giving you and develop a robust and performant architecture for this design that the engineering team can use as a basis for developing the software. Place the design doc in the same directory as the API spec.
/Users/mariog/Work/resume_app/planning/api_specification.md
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Analyzed the request and determined that the API specification at `planning/api_specification.md` needed to be read before proposing an architecture. Initiated a read of the file to gather requirements.

---

### 2. User Prompt

```
[read_file for 'planning/api_specification.md'] Result:
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Received the full contents of the API specification, which detailed endpoints, data models, Google Sheets integration, authentication, error handling, and implementation guidance. Prepared to synthesize an architecture design based on this information.

---

### 3. User Prompt

```
[plan_mode_respond] Result:
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Presented a detailed architecture plan in markdown, covering system overview, high-level architecture, data flow, key design decisions, security, performance, extensibility, project structure, testing strategy, and future enhancements. Instructed the user to toggle to Act mode to generate the design doc.

---

### 4. User Prompt

```
[The user has switched to ACT MODE, so you may now proceed with the task.]
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Acknowledged the switch to Act mode and prepared to write the architecture design document to the planning directory.

---

### 5. User Prompt

```
[write_to_file for 'planning/architecture_design.md'] Result:
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Confirmed successful creation of `planning/architecture_design.md` with the full architecture design content, formatted for engineering use.

---

### 6. User Prompt

```
[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted 22 hours ago. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/mariog/Work/resume_app'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Reviewed the context and confirmed that the previous task (writing the architecture design doc) had been completed successfully. No further action was required for resumption.

---

### 7. User Prompt

```
I would now like you to review our entire chat history and write up a post-mortem of all the work we did. Include all of my prompts verbatim, along with a summary of your response to each prompt. Write it to a new file in the 'postmortems root of the repo. Be thorough in your writeup, we will need this info for posterity.
```

**Assistant Summary:**  
Initiated the process of reviewing the chat history, extracting all user prompts and summarizing each assistant response, and prepared to write a comprehensive post-mortem to `postmortems/Chat_History_Postmortem.md`.

## Conclusion

This post-mortem documents the collaborative process of designing and documenting the architecture for the Job Application Tracker. All user prompts and assistant actions have been preserved for future reference and project transparency.
