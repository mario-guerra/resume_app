## User Prompts and Assistant Responses

---

### 1. User Prompt

> Based on this product requirements document, I need you to define the API that will be needed to support this app. Define all routes, request and response models, and authentication/authorization requirements. Create a new document and place it in the same directory as the PRD.
> 
> /Users/mariog/Work/resume_app/planning/product_requirements_document.md

**Assistant Response:**  
Read the PRD, analyzed requirements, and planned to define the API specification including all routes, models, and auth requirements.

---

### 2. User Prompt

> The backend data storage of the job data will be a Google Sheet. How does this impact the API?

**Assistant Response:**  
Explained the implications of using Google Sheets as the backend, including CRUD mapping, OAuth, schema constraints, error handling, and user data isolation.

---

### 3. User Prompt

> I need an API for creating a new Google Sheet to track jobs when the user first signs in to their Google account via the app.

**Assistant Response:**  
Added a `POST /sheets/init` endpoint to the API spec for creating and initializing a Google Sheet for each user.

---

### 4. User Prompt

> The sheet title must be required in the init request, call it "Job_Tracker"

**Assistant Response:**  
Updated the API spec to require the sheet title "Job_Tracker" in the init request and return a 400 error if not provided.

---

### 5. User Prompt

> Review this API specification from the perspective of a junior developer tasked with implementing the backend scaffolding code and business logic. Does this document contain sufficient information for you to complete the task? If not, what are the gaps?

**Assistant Response:**  
Reviewed the spec, identified strengths, and listed gaps such as missing schema details, OAuth flow, business logic examples, analytics logic, reminders storage, error examples, security practices, and environment guidance.

---

### 6. User Prompt

> Provide suggestions for each gap, based on your experience as a senior developer working off this PRD:
> /Users/mariog/Work/resume_app/planning/product_requirements_document.md

**Assistant Response:**  
Provided actionable suggestions for each gap, including adding schema tables, OAuth steps, CRUD pseudocode, analytics logic, reminders tab schema, error payloads, security best practices, and stack recommendations.

---

### 7. User Prompt

> Using your suggestions as a basis, continue your role as a senior developer and add these details to the API specification document.

**Assistant Response:**  
Outlined a plan to add all suggested details to the API spec, including schema, OAuth, business logic, analytics, error handling, security, and stack guidance.

---

### 8. User Prompt

> Review this revised document once again from the perspective of a senior developer tasked with implementing the scaffolding code and business logic of this app. Does the spec provide sufficient detail for you to implement the design? If not, what are the gaps?

**Assistant Response:**  
Reviewed the revised spec, found it highly actionable, and identified only minor gaps: sheet initialization logic, ID generation, pagination/filtering, rate limiting, and testing guidance.

---

### 9. User Prompt

> Provide suggestions for resolving these gaps based on your expertise and experience as a senior developer.

**Assistant Response:**  
Suggested adding pseudocode for sheet creation, specifying UUIDs for IDs, documenting pagination/filtering, recommending exponential backoff for rate limits, and providing testing strategies.

---

### 10. User Prompt

> Now, continuing your role as a senior developer, add these details to the specification based on your suggestions and following the PRD.

**Assistant Response:**  
Planned to append a new section with advanced implementation details, including all the above suggestions, to the API specification.

---

### 11. User Prompt

> Very good. Now, review this revised document once again from the perspective of a senior developer tasked with implementing the scaffolding code and business logic of this app. Does the spec provide sufficient detail for you to implement the design? If not, what are the gaps?

**Assistant Response:**  
Confirmed the document is now comprehensive and implementation-ready, with no significant gaps remaining.

---

### 12. User Prompt

> I would now like you to review our entire chat history and write up a post-mortem of all the work we did. Include all of my prompts verbatim, along with a summary of your response to each prompt. Write it to a new file in the 'postmortems' directory in the root of the repo. Be thorough in your writeup, we will need this info for posterity.

**Assistant Response:**  
Created this post-mortem, summarizing the entire collaboration, all user prompts, and assistant responses for future reference.

---

## Conclusion

This post-mortem captures the full scope of the collaborative design and specification process for the resume_app project. The iterative approach, detailed feedback, and progressive refinement of the API specification resulted in a robust, actionable document suitable for backend implementation by developers of varying experience levels.
