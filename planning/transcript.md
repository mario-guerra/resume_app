E-mail. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 

You need to be the leader. No. The. 

Speaker 2 

Alright. So Mario, I was thinking. I I applied for unemployment and I know you have a great idea of how to back of the application and I was thinking was doing. I haven't done this in seven years. You know Android language and I don't know how good. Either would be doing that, but I'm assuming it would be fairly good because I was thinking. Maybe do this? Of making. Maybe we can make quick application of learning by right like like just quick application where you can put GitHub class engineer and then please apply not apply application. Basically, we're going to still continue doing everything with the right name and letter that everything that you have, the official one big one where we can. Sitting at a coffee shop, I'll have to go on my computer. Yellow job or not? Does that make sense? 

Speaker 3 

Sorry, the audio is cutting messed up so I'm having a hard time. It's like it comes floats in and out and it's just stream labs. So before we got on stream lab it was fine. 

Speaker 2 

Again. 

Speaker 3 

But now with Stream Lab it's like it you fade in and out a little bit, so I didn't catch all of that. I heard something about. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

GitHub and an app for applying. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 2 

All right, so I don't know what's happening with screening yard today. So let's look to teams to plan and then I'll figure out how the what's happening with this one. So, yeah, let's go back. All right. It's really weird because I've been reporting and it has happened in the past. Maybe I have to restart my computer, but I don't know what happened. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know. That's interesting because now your audio is perfectly clear. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I did update. The only problem that I have with premier is that it is browser based. There is another one so ecam live. It's a lot more expensive like $700.00 a year, but that one is native, so you know you can download and it only works on Mac. So yeah, maybe something with this anyway, so my. 

Speaker 3 

Is there really no solution like you know like? Open broadcast studio. That allows us to do what streamer does, but maybe not as awesome but. 

Speaker 2 

It is. It is with big in India, but it's really annoying. It's really annoying because. You and I like hot enough or. Have to. Start recording because you have to send the link and the link has to be created while I'm inside of studio and then delete the test and then I have to open another one for you to share your screen so it is very complicated. 

Speaker 3 

That's already too many steps. 

Speaker 2 

It. Complicated if you're reporting yourself. Sure, all the edges perfect, but for each of these collaboration anyway, so my idea. 

Speaker 1 

It is. 

Speaker 2 

Mario is this. We're using GitHub to keep track, which I still need to complete. Since I have the steps, I haven't done it, but since I'm not looking for actively looking for a job, I'm not. And I'm sorry to make it, however today. 

Speaker 3 

I said right go. 

Speaker 2 

Ahead today I'll apply for my first week of unemployment, and I did apply for three jobs just. You know all of that, but next week I'm. The. Going to have. Keep track of this. So this is my idea. Give up. It's great. It seems to work amazing. I really like how we tell you are and all the information that you put in there. That's a great plan. Why don't to pass? Ether compiler and byte coding. Why don't we make our version of Hello World but for a mobile application I work for I work for the athlete and in the past. Seven or eight years ago haven't touched it since then, but I used iPhone use iPhone too. OK, OK, we'll have to do some virtual testing on Android, but what I was thinking is why don't we write code an application and instead of doing it just a hello world or A to do app? Which is the first application that you build when you're learning reactive, why don't we make? Yeah. Job tracker application. It's just as simple to do, but it's like Amazon Web Services stuff engineer. You know, you put that and then instead of to do complete sending or whatever, we just could apply on this day shirt back, haven't heard back or something. Something really basic, but something that helps us. Yeah, right. OK. So I'm thinking that would be a good idea to continue testing if a profiler or any other one of those CLI which if you run out of chosen life you see I just keep track of the. Tokens, if you could get charged. And then. I still have tokens I'm sure, so we can use my account to build this application and then we publish it, or we just tell people you know what? Here is the whatever PDK or whatever the package and just install it in your machine and so you can. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

That one of the reasons that I would like to to do it, we can at some point I would like to have something in the Apple Store published, even if it's free, that's. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

That sounds good. I think that would be useful. And I think maybe we should spend some time defining some requirements like what? So we can. 

Speaker 2 

100%. 

Speaker 3 

Put together a PRD for this that we can use to give the copilot. Or gcli or whatever to help build this. So I mean it. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Sounds like it. At the very least, it sounds like what we're saying from what you're saying is like you enter the job or or link a job, maybe like I applied for this job On this date. Like, haven't heard back yet. Still waiting? Or I had an interview some way to track your status in the the interview flow. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. 

Speaker 3 

Right. Whether it's and then I guess we need to define what those steps are like. You know, there's the waiting to hear back applying and waiting to hear back. And then there's contact, whether it's whether it's the thank you. But please hold off or or we'd like to talk to you. 

Speaker 2 

Yes. Following along. 

Speaker 3 

Phone screen. 

Speaker 2 

Or your or your on your own follow up right like I applied last last week. I heard back from the recruiter and it's been a week. Maybe it's time for me to nudge them and just let them know. And then that's a beautiful thing. We can put a notification in there, right, like a reminder to say, remind me by Monday at 4:00 PM if I. Haven't heard back. You sent that letter on Tuesday, 9:00 AM. Right. Like, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And UM. Anything else you know, somebody on LinkedIn posted a I think it's called. A. Sanka chart you know that shows the like the flow. Of how things like you know, they applied to this many jobs and only so many of them led to this and so many of them led to the follow up. And then I thought that was an interesting visual we could just for the heck of it, do something like that as well. 

Speaker 2 

100% and and I notice. And a bunch of the people that I've been reading about is people that say have had different times. Lately. I only heard back 30 times, so 10%. I only heard back from that 10% only 10% led into an interview right? Only one interview out of that one. And then they say, you know what I realized during these three months that I've been doing this? I realized that I decided I'm going to start my own company or I'm going to go back to school or I decided I'm going to become a cobbler, right? Like those are very impact. Impactful. Like meaningful posts. So if if we are able to by the time that we get hired to our dream job or whatever, we're able to come up with data. 

Speaker 4 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

Besides all of these steps I took, it's very important #1 #2 publishing solutions for other people that are going. It shows empathy. It shows initiative. It shows that we are truly part of the Community. We're trying to help other people, teaching them what help with us and making it easier for us. So for me. 

Speaker 1 

This is. Great. 

Speaker 3 

I want to add to that before I forget like I I agree with all of that. I think one thing that would be very helpful is like for let's say the going back to your analogy or the story of the 300 resumes and 30 responses analyze those 30 companies, the resumes, what are the common denominators? Right. So that way I can focus maybe on the companies where my. I'm strongest width, right? Because these are the the types of things that are generating responses for me versus just spray and pray, right? It's like, OK, you know what I mean? Like, let me focus in on are there are there factors, one of the things here that are. Common. That maybe help me define what my skills are or what I should be focusing on. Because this is where I'm getting traction. 

Speaker 2 

Then there might be. This might be an extra step of complexity, but maybe what we can do, Mario is when we apply for the application in your GitHub, you know how you go through it and say see if I'm a strong match or something, but some kind of ranking or some put some kind of percentage and say. Your resume matches 75% and then when we're done, we're able to say, oh, that's funny. Every company that I heard back, I matched 80% or more or let's see if there's some some kind of data that we can grab from. 

Speaker 1 

That information so. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, I like that. I like that. Yeah, I think the more data that we can collect and kind of extrapolate. Insights from the better off this will be. 

Speaker 2 

Then. Give me one second. Let me let me figure this out. So how is you're the perfect person for this one? Just remember, I'm off the cuff. Like, hey, let's just start thinking about an idea and execute. You're really good at planning, and I mean, you're Mr. Ispec and now we are doing this like the clarity coding and everything. So I think this is perfect like we can. Design this in a better way and plan it better. One of the things is. That I like how I do things. That's my personality. I always say it's because I am a big, big. I'm not. How can I say it? I'm like labor plate, right? Like I'm a heightened. I want to get you really excited. This is like you're going to talk about. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Chuck, they had the amazing lyrics. Everybody did the amazing music and Flavor Flav was in front of them, just doing the little dance and just typing up people. Yeah, exactly. So I'm going to buy a big watch, but and then instead of putting veneers, I'm going to put gold tea. But this is the thing. 

Speaker 4 

Right. Yeah, boy, yes. 

Speaker 2 

I love that because that's how it gets you excited to do the things and I love that. So that's why I think developer advocate is my jam or community because I can just go in front and and do what the infront people do right that is like give me a. Prompt. Tell me what you want to do. 

Speaker 3 

You can do this song and dance, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. All right, so. We're letting you speak, Madam. In FEMA, we can. We can just create the screens, not not the design yet, but you say, OK, what is the first step? The application second set, you know they put your name. If you want to log in and create your account or something, we can check on that one. But the first step would. The. Download the application, install the application and then put your name. And then put the the the fields that you think it should be right, like position linked to position date. And then status right apply pending per back or all of those things and then just a plus sign to say continue creating more of those ones and then custom one that says you know add more fields to the ones that we have predefined, right, it's totally customizable. You can change absolutely everything and then once you click on those ones. You can play OK. Yeah. I saw a reaction. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, the totally customizable. You can change everything like when it gets really open-ended, it gets very difficult to test. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

Right, so I am. I am much more in favor of a very limited subset that we can like. Launch with let's say MVP, and then depending on how that goes, you know people want more stuff. Then we can provide more stuff. This is one thing I learned from the API stewardship board is you know you launch with the minimal stuff because. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

You've got to support. 

Speaker 4 

That forever, right? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And so if it turns out being a nightmare to support this total customization, then. Let's let's not start with that. Let's start simple and build up from that. 

Speaker 1 

I love it. 

Speaker 2 

I love it. Thank you for reminding me. Let me see. So let me log in into my Sigma. 

Speaker 4 

You. 

Speaker 2 

And then how have you used treatment? Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

A little bit. I mean I've not used it extensively, but I have used it. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Let me go. To Cigna and I'll send it to you, this is a good tool to. 

Speaker 1 

To to use so. 

Speaker 2 

And to put it that you've been working on it, especially if you for some reason Microsoft was pushing us to use it for some reason in our team. We didn't Microsoft. Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Everybody in. 

Speaker 2 

For some reason, not all of us used. 

Speaker 1 

No. 

Speaker 2 

It I do. 

Speaker 1 

Give me one answer. Transman. So just. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's. Think about the logic or the the actual application. There about these loads. So what is it? Landing page where we do it quick information, you know. 

Speaker 3 

We're talking about a mobile app, right? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Aye. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So wasn't your wife interested in learning how to code some mobile applications? Perfect. See. This comes in the right. And that's the reason why I came up with the idea. We can have various right. And then we can do something together. And this is going to help me a lot too. So this is great. 

Speaker 4 

Application yes. 

Speaker 2 

Alright, it's not sending me the the thing. 

Speaker 4 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

So OK, if you want to start thinking about. What the experience would be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, like the user journey. So somebody. Let's say if this was me, let's say and because I'm. I'm using my computer to track things right, like I applied here. The kicker though is that I'm trying to figure out how I would map this, like if I'm on my computer and I've. Got. My resume on on my computer and then I do all that application and then. I have to pick up my phone. And somehow input all this information there. That is an extra. I'd say step that. Personally, I'm not likely to do so. How can we? How can we make this so where? Like if we're going to be making a? Mobile. App then how do we make it so somebody would actually want to use it? Like make it as simple as possible? 

Speaker 2 

Well, it can be connected to. 

Speaker 

Yes. 

Speaker 3 

So when I push stuff to GitHub it gets populated in the app, so the app has. Pulls GitHub and can see all that information. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, it's it's a little bit more complex than we gotta do that, but yeah. 

Speaker 3 

What? That's more complex. What did you have? Like what we're proposing would have required some kind of database in the back end, right? 

Speaker 2 

Villages. Yeah, it will have to. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

A database that is. So we're going to connect the database to GitHub, you know, and we're going to define the fields to say, you know what it gives up. There's a new entry. 

Speaker 4 

Is that right? 

Speaker 2 

And every new entry in this repo means a new job or a new position, and then we're going to figure out, because if it's going to be, you know, the the structure, it says Adobe and then you kind of have to five different roles reaching Adobe, right. So we're going to have to define in the database. And it's like, OK, pick up if it's from a doggie and then black. Position is from. Adobe and what is the steps that we have taken? 

Speaker 1 

That that doesn't happen. Right. 

Speaker 3 

Well, so let's back up a second. So. We have to, I think we clearly need to define the value add. Why would somebody want this right? And we talked about data collection, so. What is the value proposition? So if you use this app, it's going to keep track of your response rates, your rejection rates. It will help you identify the types of roles where you're actually getting responses, and therefore will help you. Like, what else? What else can we throw in there? That would make it useful. 

Speaker 2 

So first of all, I have a lunch meeting with the Communications director of Goodwill today. I'm not going to take this is a difference. Meeting. But if she asked me. How how do you plan to positions? Have you done this? What have you done right? I can pull out my phone and just tell her right like, oh, this is what I've been doing, right? That's the first one you need to have it in my. Hands. You know the status of what it's happening. The majority of the work is going to be done in the desktop at home. Grab their. But I want to be able to do that and I want to be able to do it both ways. So if she tells me. Then you have to. You should apply for new builds as a position for product managers in blah blah blah blah blah. I can put in getting pending but I can push to my computer because I'm going to forget most of the time I catch myself or whatever, but I can add it and then that one is going to create go to the database and the database that create. Something. That we imagine, is that OK? This one is pending. Give your use the steps that you need to do. Does that make sense? Yep. 

Speaker 3 

So then that does make sense. So then what would you like? What do you think the? UI should look like. Like I'm thinking cards to represent each position with some minimal. Information like title, date, apply, status like some kind of icon that represents the status, whether it's pending or rejection or contact. Because I've been doing that in GitHub right, like pending. Yellow dot or question mark? Rejection big Red X contact is the green check, right? So something like that I don't know. What makes sense to you from a UI perspective? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Can you see my screen? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Hold on. Let me increase the size here. Just give me a second. OK, I can see it. 

Speaker 2 

So login screen right or login page you know logo welcome. To the app. 

Speaker 1 

That. Let's see. 

Speaker 

And. 

Speaker 2 

We can clean it up later, but then. We take to it. Straight. Here by saying add new. 

Speaker 1 

Let's see, you know. 

Speaker 2 

The prospect. 

Speaker 1 

OK. Chase status. 

Speaker 2 

You know super basic at the end, like at the landing. You know that these are links. These two are links. I believe prospects, you know adding to the queue to say, oh, somebody told me about this one and then you go to the next page. 

Speaker 1 

Uh. 

Speaker 2 

I will clean up too quick, but then I will link this so. I'm I miss them. Big gun, correct you right now because the other one would actually create it. Video animation. If you know there's an onclick event in this one and it opens and everything, so we can just close the idea. So you for add a new process if you click on add, a new prospect is company. What are the things that we are important company? 

Speaker 3 

Job title. 

Speaker 2 

Patient or arcade book title? 

Speaker 1 

Huh. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, location matters too. 

Speaker 2 

Location. Yeah, I think that's how I messed up my opportunity for the last time as well that I could. Not willing to relocate. In fact, I'm not willing to relocate anywhere in the United States. I will never live anywhere else if it's not saddled. I paid the other part of the country that I will be ready for you. Looking to Europe? And put that one automatically kicked me out and I can fix this. So who knows? So company subtitle location. They. Apply or not, no. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, so would it make sense like link to job or job description? 

Speaker 1 

Huh. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. Liebers are off that. In contact, for example, who recommended you? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, which should be optional because you know not every job you apply to is going to be. A you're going. To have a referral or a contact. 

Speaker 2 

What I need is who told you about the job? Like, even if it's like my friend Misha told me. Ohh I hear. That this position is open. She was the one that gave me that right. And then maybe I can follow up with her. 

Speaker 3 

Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. I I think that's a good idea. I'm. Just. Saying like, not every job like I've applied to a lot of jobs on LinkedIn or whatever that I have no referrals that just I found them on LinkedIn. So optional is good. 

Speaker 1 

Yep. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Well. They they, there's that. Remember he told me. The one that I like about this is that if you go to interview or if if you bought from them or you can hear it, then you can come back to the six months ago. I'm working on it like like what I want to do. That's. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Uh. Who told you? About the, that's the. That's the optional, but. And then optional 2 would be. Referral. Internal contact so that way we can reach. Out to. To the person that works for that same company and say, hey, can you fill or refill or something if they? If we end up finding out so this one. The. Traffic right? Like add. Hmm. 

Speaker 1 

That's. I. 

Speaker 2 

Had a fever yesterday and they all looked up like nothing. Really. Like I didn't sleep well on Saturday night. I woke up with verbal pain yesterday. I did a total test and everything. I spent the whole day in bed watching TV and everything. Fever, fever, fever. And then I went to bed like I didn't get out of my room like I sit in my room all day. I only. Drink. You know, plucking shakes all day because I wasn't even hungry. I was feeling horrible. 

Speaker 4 

So late I would have. 

Speaker 2 

Headache. Everything didn't take medication. I should give a profit until like 9:00 at night to see if I could sleep better. I woke up at 6:00. I've had a full night's sleep, even though I was sleeping on and off yesterday. I looked up today. Normal temperature or nothing? I don't know what happened. It was just like one day, bugs. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, come. Local. OK. 

Speaker 2 

I. 

Speaker 1 

Guess, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

I'm talking to. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, that's. 

Speaker 2 

Anyway. 

Speaker 1 

Good. 

Speaker 2 

So then. This is the start. 

Speaker 1 

Good stuff. 

Speaker 2 

OK, this is the concept. And then we're going to have to think about the logic, right, like in the in the this stuff like. But first, let's just do the user story, right, so. Are you OK with this? Page? Said you prospect page. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I mean, this is pretty much what I I think one other thing that is good to know is. Like a line about like a brief company description because you know, in my case, I've applied to a lot of companies and it's like, oh, I've never heard of this company before. And then I forget. A week later, what the company does. So I. Started adding in. A little field like. OK, it's cloud services or. You know, workflow automation or blah blah blah so. So some kind of company description field. Of what they do. 

Speaker 2 

Users. Yeah. 

Speaker 

Alright. 

Speaker 2 

That sounds good. 

Speaker 3 

Sure. And and date applied. 

Speaker 2 

All right. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. Because she went to the. 

Speaker 2 

The date I'm going to keep it open because I don't know if it's date applied. Remember this is. We are at lunch or at networking event and they're adding this one, so technically I didn't apply yet, but the date when I heard of it. 

Speaker 3 

Then you should do you want to feel that says applied yes, no. 

Speaker 2 

I think it would be in the check status. 

Speaker 3 

Wait, OK, OK. All right. Need to. 

Speaker 1 

And the. 

Speaker 2 

Can we have 2 pages, right? Have you bought pets? 

Speaker 3 

Right, right. But if you, if you have a, if you add a new prospect and you don't have a field that says applied yes or no, when you check the status, there's no status to check. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. OK, apply. Yeah. You got a difference. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, you're correct. 

Speaker 2 

It's really interesting having always saying for the rest of the years that difference in cultural to the US used to say that. We. This already because everybody's talking bad about my idea. Isn't it funny? Like it's. It's really funny. I've been working with a professor and every time that I have to give him. Back he feels bad because he's a professor. Computer science at the university. Every time that I'm taking him back and I'm going to give you what I want to think, I'm going to give you feedback. So when I said like, oh, have you considered doing this is like. It. Tells that. So what I'm saying is not OK, I said. No, no, no. Don't have nothing to do. But I'm not doubting you. If anything, I want you to propose in my logic. 

Speaker 3 

Right, this is a collaboration. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Like I mean if. If we can't collaborate, then one of. Us is redundant. 

Speaker 2 

Well, and then hoping you able to look for you could collaborate with somebody, gonna give you the time, right? So check that and we can always go back. I sent you the link to this so. A. Sent them. You can fully come back and just. Add stuff. Any perfects page? 

Speaker 1 

Prospect. And then. 

Speaker 2 

This is for is for many, for ideas and what I like when you go to the whole sheet of Sigma. We're going to be able, before we can encode one time, we should definitely create it. Here in Sigma because you're going to put the clicks and everything. And watch doing everything and we see the flow. Then we start. People are not like they because they spend several months just going through this and then we can. This is why you. Start talking. We'll fix it later. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. I think it's definitely. I've learned that it's just. It's definitely better to start. With a good foundation first. Right. You start coating first, you end up. 

Speaker 4 

Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

Having to go clean a lot of crap up later. 

Speaker 2 

You're not. You're not. I've clicked that. So come on. Of course you have to define the APIs correctly since the beginning. It's like when when. There's written development and detainment then. There's right the test. 

Speaker 3 

It just forces you to think about. Outcomes, right? Like what are you trying to accomplish? 

Speaker 2 

Have you seen that viral tick? I'm not a tick tock, but everybody sends it to me. He's an engineer and A and a. Test. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

That guy's software developer and testing whatever, and then yeah, exactly. The test. 

Speaker 3 

Is that the person putting the shapes in the shape they all fit in the square and she's just going crazy. Yes, I've seen that. 

Speaker 2 

They open it to 10. I actually like it a lot and I used it in my personal life. When I'm trying to explain to my mom gets reoffended when I ask her follow up questions. So I I use that. Oh yeah, yeah. My mom is a Jewish mom, and I know it's wrong to say it, but it's leading health. And and respect right respect your elders. Never tell your elders that they will never try to help them. They're your elders. I'm the oldest. And I'm in my mid 40s. But I'm still being seen as a baby in my family. The youngest. Even though the one that keeps up with the doctors with the with the paperwork. Inheritance. And everything it's taken care of by me. 

Speaker 4 

Is taking. Right. 

Speaker 2 

They still have to hear from my older brother first. It is a very traditional thing anyway. So you went. To log in OK. Yeah, perfect. So now I'll leave you to to add what should be in the check status page. So if you click on the check down there you can start adding it just to make sure that it works. All right. Remember, Matthew was a big fan of this one. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. Ask to edit. 

Speaker 4 

Hold on. 

Speaker 

Thank you. 

Speaker 3 

I have view only. 

Speaker 2 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

Hey, what happened? 

Speaker 4 

Did you change something here? 

Speaker 2 

I approved you. 

Speaker 3 

Oh, because it all just. Went. Blank. Let me reload it. 

Speaker 1 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

No, that's weird. Yeah, my screen is entirely blank. I don't even have the little grid. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

OK, else. You know fig. Fig one may have. 

Speaker 3 

Just crept hold on. It's reloading. Figma's thinking. 

Speaker 2 

I used to have. A big. The. The full access through Microsoft and now it sucks because. Let's see job. 

Speaker 

John. 

Speaker 2 

What I created in the real suite because. It's gonna suck. If the delivery is. 

Speaker 1 

We do it. 

Speaker 2 

So let me send you a. New link. Or give me your e-mail. So I can add you as a. No, I'm going to send you Lilly. So we're going to use the wheel hub. Because the big jam is more informal, and since we are planning to make this a real product, I think it's better. 

Speaker 3 

OK, so I should close this fig jam out. 

Speaker 2 

Yep, and that's the new one. 

Speaker 

OK, hold on. 

Speaker 3 

Getting there, getting there. 

Speaker 4 

This is going to be a. 

Speaker 2 

It's. To be a. Lot better because we already have an idea. You know a template of mobile app. 

Speaker 1 

Oh. 

Speaker 3 

All right, I see something. Does e-commerce? Go touch glass. What? 

Speaker 

All right. 

Speaker 4 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

This is just a tablet, so we're going to we're going to change everything in here. So we're going to leave that one. We're going to take search. Favorites history following we're going to leave that up for. This one is going to change a little bit. It's going. 

Speaker 

He's gonna. 

Speaker 2 

To be called job search. 

Speaker 1 

Pull young. 

Speaker 2 

And then I don't know, I don't. Like those fairs that. We're going to leave it for now. 

Speaker 1 

This one is going to have to change. 

Speaker 2 

So I think favorite history following we're going to do that for now. We can change that, but it's like a quick access right to the favorite jobs because even though we're applying too many jobs. We. We might have something that. We're more interested in others. And we can actually click and add it as in my favorite right? Like this one is very important to me. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, I like that. OK. 

Speaker 1 

Is this letter? 

Speaker 2 

OK. Hi. We're going to have reading this one. 

Speaker 1 

Title. We're going to move that into Jeff. 

Speaker 2 

Remove it. Uh. Still have that call. 

Speaker 4 

Yes. 

Speaker 3 

You know, now that I'm looking at this, I'm thinking it would be nice to have different ways to group the jobs. Like a group home by. All right, what did I apply to this? 

Speaker 4 

Month. 

Speaker 3 

Group and by company. Which companies have I applied to because I've applied for multiple jobs at the same company, right? So I might want to see OK how many jobs did I apply to at core weave, let's say and then see all of those and how many? I don't know what else. Let's see how many by position, maybe like. Now I've applied to product manager jobs. Let me look at those. I've applied two solution architect jobs. Let me look at those. So I think there should be a few ways to slice and dice the the data, right? 

Speaker 2 

So we can add a filter in here. 

Speaker 4 

Right, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

And then. Then really the OR this one, because in the filter we can filter by. Position type. The location type. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 

So. 

Speaker 2 

E3. Filter playlist. 

Speaker 

Tile. 

Speaker 2 

Title. 

Speaker 1 

Why can't view the? 

Speaker 2 

What can we do instead of title here? 

Speaker 3 

UM company job. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Job title so. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, wait, no. 

Speaker 2 

Let's get back to the original idea, then. The first idea was lead or or suspect job, right? Like if you click in there to go into that page so prospect. And then the second one is daughters. 

Speaker 1 

Diet. 

Speaker 2 

Or what did we call? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, we'll call the check status. But I guess you know, looking at this, we don't need check status because you could just potentially scroll through. The list of. Jobs and get a quick up or down. 

Speaker 2 

Well then this makes it very. It makes it a lot easier again because we can say are you. 

Speaker 4 

Frost job. 

Speaker 2 

Prospects. And then just add a bunch of field just from the front page. Or would you like this to be a link and then here in the next one we can Add all the fields? Or should we be able to do it from the dev job? 

Speaker 3 

I don't know, I think. 

Speaker 2 

What is better experience? 

Speaker 

That. 

Speaker 3 

I think I like the to keep it clean, like add new prospect. And then the the list at the bottom the I like the status like. 

Speaker 2 

He opened the new. 

Speaker 3 

No, the you know you had the tiles which I thought. Was interesting because. Those could each represent a job that you had applied to. And then you could just kind of scroll swipe through to see what the status was and if you want to check all. 

Speaker 1 

That's fine. 

Speaker 3 

Like you could Click to say check status, you can either swipe tell me if this is crazy, I'm just spitballing. Here. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

The check status could be. You could either. Swipe through these to see. Some some order. I don't know what makes sense to order, like your favorites or like the jobs you really want that you've that you favorited. And then if you want to see like all of your status, then you click on check status and it takes you to the. Check. Status screen where you see. 

Speaker 4 

Maybe a list of titles or OK yeah, maybe. 

Speaker 2 

I like it. Yeah. Again, their favorite would be redundant on top. Or not. 

Speaker 4 

No. 

Speaker 3 

Would because this this list right here, I think the the swipeable list could be your favorites. Whereas. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know. Does that make sense? Does that all right? 

Speaker 2 

It does. Let's see. Let's change here. Company. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Job title. 

Speaker 1 

And then instead of rising that status. 

Speaker 2 

Price if. Yeah, I like it. 

Speaker 

Cool. 

Speaker 2 

We get all the. Hard. 

Speaker 4 

Motion company. 

Speaker 2 

And these. Because this level of planning has. In our team and this, the failure would have been so much better, I always told. And Justin? That we needed to do more. Remember when we were doing? 

Speaker 4 

Were. 

Speaker 2 

Bug bashes and stuff like that. Uh-huh. And. I was like. I know what I know and I know other people. You know, you are very solid stuff. Addy has always something to say and something really cool to show and whatever you guys are using different tools. I was like once every week. One hour or two hours instead of the stupid social hours that we always end up talking about something. Once you do this, there's your cloud. Like what? What would be a good idea? What tool are you took over child work? Whatever, there's a lot of people and that happens. When I was the weirdest person to work on, he had a very weird way of tracking and documenting and doing things. Die. And. This is between you and I, but I think you get it that way. So everybody has to rely on him, you know, just to do it, you know, like. Yeah. Kay and Justin realized that when I took over compliance because you did compliance with you privacy review for for Transpac, but it was it was unnecessarily complicated. Anyway. So OK, so we're going to, I don't know why I made that comment. Anyway, just the job to add here. 

Speaker 3 

Hey I had an idea about that. Tell me what you think. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So for prospect job, we could have some templates like oh, I've got a template for that, pre fills some aspects. I don't know if this makes sense because each job might be different but prospect job this is a. Product manager job so it pre fills the title with product manager and. I don't know. Maybe that's the only thing you can prefill, but. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So I like that. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I don't know. 

Speaker 4 

Hello. 

Speaker 3 

I'm trying to. 

Speaker 2 

Well, it can be. 

Speaker 

Think of what? 

Speaker 3 

Might make sense for a template, but like it's a prospect job for a remote product manager jobs to prefill some things for you. But. Maybe not, I don't know. 

Speaker 2 

So for now. But I do want to go back to that one. Let us think about. Why would be in the prospect job? And then we realized which ones can be reusable and like which one can right? Because it could be a drop down too. And if I do a dropdown as a product manager but we're a developer relations and stuff like that, it might be different. What I'm trying to say. Most of the jobs that you and I are looking for are going to require the same information, developer relations developer advocate. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Product management. Stuff like that, right? So it's the same thing that they're going to ask you, right? Like experience projects that you have done and all those things. 

Speaker 3 

Yep. 

Speaker 2 

So what I'm. Thinking is in here. These are the fields. And we can add right like add. 

Speaker 1 

Job title. Whoops. 

Speaker 2 

What we can do here though, is that this one can be a drop down instead of having to type. You know. In the ad job title. Instead of attribute address. Home. This is going to be nice because when you add the company in the database, it's going to immediately grab it, and if it's Microsoft, it's going to put plus one Microsoft application, right? I already applied to 15. Now I apply to 16. It's going to keep track of that and then the job title. This could be the one that. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Is the drug. 

Speaker 3 

And then so how is the drop down populated? 

Speaker 2 

It's pretty popular. It's pretty determined, right? Like with the position. You know, product management, developer advocate. 

Speaker 3 

Right. But when somebody first opens the app. Like what if they're not a product? Manager or a developer advocate. But if they're looking for engineering roles. 

Speaker 2 

Then that's it. That's it. That's a great question. So that's what we do a little bit of research and just put it because remember we this is a string, right? We're just going to Add all the job descriptions. OK. Right. And so that's it. Yeah, you're right. This is application. I'm being selfish. I'm not. I'm doing it for me. And I'm considering the four jobs that I'm interested. Yeah, but you're absolutely right. This is for the community, right? Some might. Some US people might need this. Right. So that's what we do. We just go grab. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The basic it's it's like I said, this is the string that is going to populate the drop down anyway. 

Speaker 3 

Well, it could also. I'm thinking it could be adaptive where you know it it populates based on the jobs that you have applied for. 

Speaker 2 

OK, there you. Go. 

Speaker 3 

Like if there's titles like. OK, well, if you're applying for something that's the same, here's what you've already applied for. But you know at the start you might or if you can override it by writing in your own. Thing right, because. 

Speaker 2 

Before there's any. It. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, before there's any applications, you're going to have to write it in yourself. But once there's a few. Then we could start building a list of titles. And then just pre populate it with the more common ones I guess. 

Speaker 2 

OK, sounds good. The location. Add. This one is. So we said company jumped out of location description. 

Speaker 3 

Date. Link to the job if relevant. 

Speaker 1 

Uh, link? Then this one should go away. And then we're going to replicate the. Other ones up top. And then we can add another one. 

Speaker 2 

OK, link to a job. 

Speaker 1 

Oops. Add. It's not working. All right, we'll fix it. Ah. 

Speaker 3 

So is that description of the job or description? Of the company. 

Speaker 2 

Either way you tell me. 

Speaker 3 

So say company, I think we need. 

Speaker 2 

What do you think? 

Speaker 3 

A company description. And then. I don't think we need a job description. That's what link. I guess that's what the title. Is supposed to be at the job. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Company description yeah, that's where you were saying you. 

Speaker 1 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Had you have that? 

Speaker 3 

Cloud infrastructure or workflow automation or blah blah blah. 

Speaker 4 

Wow. 

Speaker 3 

Productivity software, whatever. So you just have an idea. Of. What the what? Their core business is? 

Speaker 2 

3. OK, add link and then. No contact. 

Speaker 4 

Yep. 

Speaker 3 

Contact and referral. 

Speaker 2 

8. 

Speaker 3 

And then date. 

Speaker 1 

All. All right. 

Speaker 2 

And then. Should we add here? Total job supply. Just standing just whatever or should be in another screen. 

Speaker 4 

No, let's put. It here but it's. 

Speaker 1 

Got. 

Speaker 4 

Not it, that's good. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I think you know. Without, I don't want to overload screens, but I think at the same time having too many screens where you're having to go and search for information is also. Not great. Not a great experience. 

Speaker 2 

Number. 

Speaker 1 

Painting. 

Speaker 2 

This is what I thought horrible. I don't like that word. 

Speaker 3 

Rejection. 

Speaker 2 

Lowe's. But I think it's a good idea. Because we kind of like. It comes up kinda. Inspire you right? Like you're going to see that you continue adding stuff, so injection close. 

Speaker 1 

Let's see. This one needs to grow. Those apply OK. Whoops. What the hell had it? Number from data. Base. Number. Handing. Same. 

Speaker 4 

What else? 

Speaker 1 

This one is add. 

Speaker 2 

Remember, this one is going to add this one is going to make a call and it's going to send to the database and the database is going to be set up. That is going to create a new entry in GitHub. I'm still don't know how to do it I'm sure maybe it can create. But. Pull request. Is saying at this one. I'm sure we can figure that one out because I remember making a an application with Natalia. To be able to figure out how many open comments you had and everything, so we had a lot of access. I don't know if it because we were Microsoft Template, we had more access than a normal person. 

Speaker 4 

With. 

Speaker 2 

But I'm assuming GitHub will give you access at least to your repo information between your repo, so. So what's up? 

Speaker 3 

You mean through the API? I mean, yeah, you. Can access the API mean you have to set up a token to be able to get at it, but. 

Speaker 1 

Hmm. 

Speaker 3 

That's. You can do it. We can do it. 

Speaker 2 

So so after repo I'm going to put add to repo here and you're going to grab. They contact link to job, company description, location, job title and company. Now that's an actually send the pull request to prevent entry. You're the master of your GitHub. You're the one that did that plan. Is that enough to create the beginning? Because the double request. Can be said, and that's going to create Adobe. You know, we see Adobe in my list already exist. If it. You're going to create a new entry called product manager and then in the job description or in the link is going to be different than the previous one. So it's going to add a new one and then when you get home, you're going to be able to go into the cripple and say, oh, there you are. I'm going to prove it and. Put the rest of. The details in your computer and you approve the. PR, right? Yeah. Does that make sense? 

Speaker 3 

So it does make sense, but I'm wondering if. Using GitHub adds an extra layer of complexity on this that most people. May not really be able to deal with. 

Speaker 2 

Then how would you recommend? 

Speaker 4 

Does it does it? 

Speaker 3 

Well, I don't know. Like. You know, we talked about a database. I'm using GitHub because I know GitHub. And. I can use GitHub copilot. 

Speaker 2 

We did with ourselves. We did with ourself. 

Speaker 3 

Now I'm thinking about like you know, you talked about using a database, which means we'd have to spin up something. 

Speaker 2 

Or Google. 

Speaker 3 

And then keep like. Keep track of everybody's jobs in a database, which we have no money, right, or at least no funds. We want to allocate to this so. Somebody to use this, somebody would have to know GitHub or and then set up a GitHub account and then create a token to give to this thing. So there's it's not the easiest user experience and so. 

Speaker 2 

Is that yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I'm trying to think of like how would we how can we do? This in a way that is easy Google Sheets. 

Speaker 4 

Google. 

Speaker 2 

Google Sheets. Yeah, it's 3. We do the authentification using Google. You don't have to create an account. We do the authentication using which is. Let it go into Google Sheet. Yeah. Yeah. And you know what's nice about that one too is that we can actually connect it to Google Calendar. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. That's a good idea. So we'll pivot. So GitHub using GitHub as the back store is out in favor of Google Sheets. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And so. 

Speaker 2 

Google, Google Docs, right the Google Docs. Because we're getting you the whole. Suite. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because Google has a video where in Google Docs you can actually share your resume. Like send the page of the color letter pages and everything not Google plus so. 

Speaker 3 

Oh yeah, so if we tie this all in, then somebody could have their resume in Google Docs and be scrolling on their phone and apply and then. Somehow link their resume and then just basically. Put it all in here. So this could be a. One stop shop. I like it. I like it. 

Speaker 2 

This is the beauty of it, and that's what gets me excited. Though. It's exactly what we were talking earlier. That you know the difference between the three yard, the solution is there. It's oversized, but it requires to make steps, right? We're trying to eliminate the steps. Yeah, all of these three. Do this. It's open source, but we're really good wouldn't end up working at Apple at Google with this. 

Speaker 4 

We're going to. With. 

Speaker 2 

Now with this idea that let's see so. All right, so I just. Can you hear it now? 

Speaker 4 

The let me try. 

Speaker 3 

Reloading. OK, I can see. You can see it. Let me zoom in. 

Speaker 2 

Just double clicking anything and see if you can. 

Speaker 1 

I see you around. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I'm on the. 

Speaker 4 

So is this the San Francisco page? 

Speaker 1 

San Francisco. 

Speaker 3 

How do you edit the text? 

Speaker 2 

Double click. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. OK. 

Speaker 2 

Up there, you. So we're good to go. Alright, so one thing that we need to do then is. Since now we have a better idea. We're going to have to write the story here. 

Speaker 4 

So. 

Speaker 3 

I'm recording all of this using OBS, so I'm going to take that, convert it to a transcript, and then use AI to write up a PRD. And a user journey and I'll share that with you and we can. 

Speaker 4 

Perfect. 

Speaker 3 

Slap that information in here. 

Speaker 2 

Perfect. So this is something. Tools stack and all of. That right, like let's just let's just. Lifting the application. This is what I love about designing and something. A lot more than other. 

Speaker 

Butter. 

Speaker 1 

Thanks. OK, so for some reason it's not. This is something wrong. So let's see text. OK. 

Speaker 4 

So then. 

Speaker 2 

The app. If we need to do some research, will be used, we will log in. 

Speaker 1 

We will use. Google. Dogs. Resume. Calendar. Google suites. And so. Keep track and use. As there is. 

Speaker 4 

Yes, any cell. 

Speaker 2 

So more people use cells as a database all the time, so this is good. And the logic in, you know, throwing that cell is amazing. 

Speaker 1 

So. 

Speaker 3 

I don't think I've. 

Speaker 2 

Let us. 

Speaker 3 

Ever heard anybody call a coating? It's so amazing. 

Speaker 2 

Ohh. Amazing. Have you seen the ESPN X Games stuff? 

Speaker 1 

It's it's just. 

Speaker 3 

No, I've heard about it, but no, I've not seen it. 

Speaker 2 

Most. You know how that cell can be extremely frustrating. Yeah. Well, when you want those people in those games, you know, the competitive self competition, even if you feel even worse. That you will learn to hate and self because how can they be so good? 

Speaker 3 

I think I'm already. 

Speaker 4 

There. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. All right. So I will be used with Google Login, Google Docs and then at least we know for the rest of it is going to be in Google. Rest. In. 

Speaker 

Google. 

Speaker 4 

Oh. 

Speaker 3 

Does Google Docs support PDFs? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

All. You need other. Let's see. 

Speaker 1 

Auto. Sir, you might not doing that this but. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah, we'll figure that one out, but. 

Speaker 1 

It seems like it does. All right. 

Speaker 2 

Got it. 

Speaker 3 

Right, cause there's we would need Google Drive too, right? The most likely will use Google Docs to create the resume and then Google Drive to upload something for storage. To then use to. 

Speaker 2 

Apply for jobs. That's a good that's a good point. I need to be careful when I name products because you're absolutely right. It's going to be in Google Drive, you know, Google log in with Google Drive. Google Drive contains all the suite, Google Drive and all that, right? 

Speaker 1 

And. 

Speaker 3 

Google I mean. Google Drive is your cloud storage, right? It's. Like SharePoint? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Google Docs is where you'll revise your resume and then export it as a PDF. For storage in Google Drive that you can then use to apply to jobs. 

Speaker 2 

And then what other tools? Should we link some kind of? So let's get back. So here is where, where, where you keep track of the the the what this is. Right. These will be at native Android. However. OK. Let's get back. So this one adds it not to the repo drive. Asks. And then. 

Speaker 1 

Huh. 

Speaker 2 

So now we don't need as many screens. Honestly. But. My thing is. 

Speaker 1 

You know Christmas. 

Speaker 2 

I have an idea. So we have this one is going to add to the drive. My only thing is this one just supply number pending rejection flows, it might be too much for the same screen that can be in a different screen because I think the activity this is in the activity. We can move this one to activity. You know. Booking. And activity and instead of shock it can be notes. You know where we can add a note saying, you know, I'm feeling positive of this one or. 

Speaker 4 

Whether. 

Speaker 2 

Stuff or I have another recruiter that I can talk to at Amazon that that will be really nice, you know, put some notes in there next to the, you know that it can be tied to the job position and then in activities here we can change and. Shame that it. The number 2 activities that the activity can be, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

So OK. Go ahead, go ahead. 

Speaker 2 

In activities can be jobs applied. Number pending rejection, close and then we can do that's where we can do again the filters like companies that I have applied for. Or we can do our ranking like say, you know, that's applied more to Amazon or Google or whatever, and then just display in the activity more than whatever. All right. Because I think this one already looks to. 

Speaker 1 

Too busy? 

Speaker 2 

Should be easy. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 1 

Let's see. I made a mistake. 

Speaker 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

Let's see. Let's see. However, the next thing is. You can always. 

Speaker 2 

We. 

Speaker 1 

OK, I see what I need to do so. 

Speaker 2 

I really do like. 

Speaker 1 

These little things. 

Speaker 4 

But I don't want all of them so. 

Speaker 1 

I'm going to put it here in the meantime. Shake this up. 

Speaker 2 

Check it out. What do you think? If we do something like this. 

Speaker 1 

Always gonna come here. 

Speaker 2 

This one is is just. This. If it's just driving the numbers and displaying them, that's it. But in this one, it's like the top companies. That we have. And then we can click on the button and go. Into more details about it. 

Speaker 3 

So how do we define top companies? 

Speaker 2 

So by the numbers of applications, so in the Excel spreadsheet. If we travel. 17 Microsoft 13, Google 6 Apple. It's going to display the companies with more entries. 

Speaker 3 

Can I also I I like that I would say we should also have the option to to basically like favorite companies. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Like oh, I really want. To work at Apple, let's say so that. I star it somehow. So that should be a field. 

Speaker 

Uh. 

Speaker 3 

That. In the sheet that we specify, yeah, this is a favorite. So I want to see it here. 

Speaker 2 

I like it. So then why don't we add here that field too? From the get go. 

Speaker 1 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So the option of. 

Speaker 4 

Englishman. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I'll send to you. Yes, Sir. Just a yes or no question. Savor it. 

Speaker 4 

Favorite. 

Speaker 2 

And that way when we're adding into the database it already. Has that tab. OK. Thank you. 

Speaker 4 

I like that. 

Speaker 1 

Yes. No. OK. 

Speaker 4 

Alright, cool. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. So then? Yeah. All right. 

Speaker 2 

One time I was doing this for a family project because we were thinking about some travel and everything, and I decided to do it. Here. My mom was there something like that, all of them. They don't. Nobody knows much about that. It was so much fun, everybody. And whatever. And then it's all like get paid for doing this ****, you know, like, I know, like, yeah, you can get paid almost $100,000 for doing this every single day. Of course. Right. So I was like. Imagining you. You know, but I was like, yeah, you can make it clear out of this dude because like. Of course you can. I think you like people, have it the best. 

Speaker 1 

This out. 

Speaker 2 

It's so much fun anyway, OK. 

Speaker 4 

I. Know this is this is cool. 

Speaker 2 

All right. This is the engineer or a product manager. This should be manager because you have to say it out loud. Your logic, your navigation, your everything and how many times you have. At least I have my first portfolio website. As. Issues. When I was. The navigation sucks and I get stuck. You know, and I was using express navigation and express, yes. And all those things and he sucked. Said when you click it linked to job open this, it would have been better like I just, I didn't think God's logic and everything. So I think this is a tool that use it more often, even with your wife and your family life, right? Like this is a good idea to plan this way anyway. So. One more time we're going to log in using. The info I mean. Google login. 

Speaker 3 

So somebody that is going to require somebody to have a. Google account then? Right, OK. Which is I'm just stating that as a requirement, right? 

Speaker 2 

And not not free, but the only requirement storage. We can come up with a different thing, but it will have to be paid because we will have to pay for. Regatta. And all of those things. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, let's start with the free stuff. So then that means we're going to have to support authentication with Google. Right, so the app's going to authenticate with Google. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

And then you will. Go through when it starts up. I guess. Do we? There will be no jobs or anything yet. Right. So it should probably ask you, do you have an existing resume that you want to upload? Then. If that if there is, then it will. Get stored in drive. If not. Do you want to create one? 

Speaker 2 

We will create it for us. Yeah, we will have to. So we're still missing the. That's not the landing page anymore. So then the face would be. All right, let's get back to that one. 

Speaker 4 

1st. 

Speaker 2 

Time. Page, right? So we're going to go. Login. 

Speaker 4 

Oops. 

Speaker 1 

Hey. Login using Google. Account right? 

Speaker 2 

And then we're going to have to have another page. And this one. You have. We're going to change all of this later on, but do you have an existing project we're going to tell? The project for now. If they click yes. No, I have to the third one because if they click yes, you're going to have to. Link us to the folders. But that's complicated because you're going to have to link to all of that. Well, not really, because calendar sheets and all of that is within Google Cloud anyway. But you'll be getting. 

Speaker 3 

Well, I mean, if somebody logs in and they've already got a Google account and they've already. Got all that stuff then? They're good, right? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, if I already have a folder with my resume and everything, I will have to link it to this one. Yes? So so do you have an existing project? Yeah. When you click on that one, it's going to save you to that one and choose the folders that you're. Going to be using. Does that make sense? 

Speaker 3 

Well, I think. Calling it an existing project is a little bit confusing. 

Speaker 2 

It is exactly. That's the point that I'm trying to make. See. So is it. 

Speaker 3 

The existing resume or what do we mean by project here? 

Speaker 2 

So. Yeah, you're right. Projects are not the right word. Order for 800 resumes your application. All of that, I think. For us, which is start from scratch and then I. Can drop later. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. We should not assume like just start from zero. 

Speaker 

MHM. 

Speaker 2 

We're going to call this job hunting. When we do that. We are going to set up a folder, a template that is going to include in Google Drive is going to include create one folder that is going to call resume inside the resumes folder there's going to be. A Google Sheets. And then that's it. So in the folder you're going to be adding your resumes in there. And in the Google sheet is where he's going to add and applying for Microsoft product manager, Redmond Cloud and security. Whatever, right. And then he starts creating the jobs from there. So it starts from scratch. Now, if you already have that for some reason in. PowerPoint and Excel or whatever you can. England and convert it into the Excel sheet that we are going to get in our template. You can pop the job manually right topic Place is fine but the logic is already going to be given by us. You know the formulas for the Excel for the Google sheet. It's going to be done by in the template, right? Like it's going to say column one is job description, column two is company column three. Information you have all of this and then come up with a formula that says how many, how many Microsoft jobs have you applied and then that's the number that we're going to put it here and then how many location remote 100% remote. Here is the data, right? That when we start thinking about data collection right, like how we're going to grab all these data and do something with it perfect. So starting up new job hunting. 

Speaker 

Further. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

So when we do that then. Go ahead. 

Speaker 4 

Oops. 

Speaker 2 

They log in. They create a new project. I'm going to call it gorgeous. So it's the whole thing. 

Speaker 4 

That. OK. 

Speaker 2 

We will have a template with. 

Speaker 1 

The. We both. 

Speaker 4 

Good. 

Speaker 2 

Drive. Guys, what is it called Google Drive folder. 

Speaker 4 

There. 

Speaker 2 

That includes. 

Speaker 

Cheese. 

Speaker 1 

To keep track. 

Speaker 4 

Of. 

Speaker 3 

John. 

Speaker 2 

Jobs. Baby company, etc. And then. So oh, and folder to keep reselling. 

Speaker 1 

Your cinemas. 

Speaker 2 

By company and some folder. 

Speaker 1 

Good. 

Speaker 

The station. 

Speaker 1 

Position. 

Speaker 3 

Or yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Job. 

Speaker 

Number. 

Speaker 1 

Or job OK, you understand what job right like. 

Speaker 4 

Because it's like it's going to. 

Speaker 2 

This is. He's. We're going to create the template, we're going to create the option to create new company. So if in Excel if we're using this app to get a prospect job and I put Adobe Internet create and if the logic is going to be if it doesn't exist a folder named Adobe create one inside the resume. 

Speaker 3 

So then. Why do we need a folder for Adobe? Are we storing anything? For Adobe, like it's all going into the the Google sheet. 

Speaker 4 

No, no, right. 

Speaker 2 

Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, unless we're tailoring resumes for the job. Which, like I don't know that we want to support that in the first iteration. Because I could see the possibility of integrating. 

Speaker 1 

Hello. 

Speaker 3 

Gemini, Google, Gemini AI into this but I don't I don't want. To start with that, right? Like like I'd say. 

Speaker 2 

And. Eve. 

Speaker 3 

I don't know that we need folders at this point because we're using the spreadsheet to keep track of. On this. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's why I need you here, man. So this is what we're going to do then, MVP. That. It would be this idea is we're going to. Have a mobile app to add. Jobs on the go, right? The majority of the work we're doing it at home like at normal at all. Right? Like responsible at all. You know, you do your research, you do some preparation before applying. And all of that, these are the only thing that we're doing here is so you keep track of something that. Came up. When you were out and about. I think it provides somebody maybe not going to lend you the job maybe, but this is going to keep you more organized. You're going to be able to check how many companies have you applied, how many jobs, what's going on. Hi. 

Speaker 3 

I mean this is. A stretch, but what would make it really? Cool is if we said. Like provide a link to the like. Here's the job I'm applying for and then have have it go to Gemini. And Jim and I like pull out all the relevant information to pre populate these fields to make it super simple, right? But. And we can we can look. 

Speaker 2 

That person 2. That's version two, yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Into that. OK. All right, that's not for the MVP. 

Speaker 2 

So at the beginning what I told you was let's make our. We're trying to make an application mobile application right like. 

Speaker 1 

I'm. To. 

Speaker 2 

To learn something new, to show to prospective employers that and continue learning, that's rate as information that's continuous improvement. That was the whole idea. And I said you'll do it. Hello, World world. Right. Like, unless something that. We are. That seems we're looking for a job. This is. This is great so far just to keep adding what you're saying right now. Right. Because if I'm healing, how easy would it be for Gemini to just go and grab all of that and just grab and give you a brief description? They already have your resume. In the MVP? Absolutely. Gemini. Immediately you can have a ranking or some kind of thing that says you're 73%. I mean LinkedIn does it. You're 70.3%, yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Raton does it? Yes. 

Speaker 2 

I think it's it's not out of this. You know. It's not that crazy to think. Yeah, this could be in the MVP. Is it should be. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. I mean, I feel like anything these days, you know, AI needs to be table stakes. 

Speaker 

Read me. 

Speaker 3 

So we should think about that. Like, if we can do that. We maybe we should. 

Speaker 2 

I don't see why we couldn't do it, because it seems fairly simple. Maybe not easy, but it feels simple, you know, because we know how to integrate. I mean, there might be a Gemini agent or an MCP that we can use, right? 

Speaker 3 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Some kind of I like it. I like it because it's showing the extra step. To add that element of AI to give you for example. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Instead of giving you the positive, maybe it can be tell me why I'm not good for this one and what I need to do in my resume in order to be more appealing to this position or recommendation of what do I need to learn or work on in order to be more competent for this position? 

Speaker 1 

Yes. 

Speaker 2 

That's a great idea because that's another data. 

Speaker 4 

You OK? 

Speaker 2 

Right. If I apply for 10 positions of product management and security because I've been working with privacy, you know, compliance and all of those things and I always end up at 70%, there might be two or three courses that I can take. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

To strengthen that thing, so I work more on goal. I'm a goal oriented guy, so I don't like you telling me, Hector, you're really good at planning. You're amazing at communication. No, I want you to tell me, Hector, this is the things that you should learn or that you should be better at. Because I already know my stress. 

Speaker 3 

Yep. Yeah. Tell me what the gaps are so I can fill the gaps. 

Speaker 2 

So that's a beautiful thing because the majority of the. The tools that I've seen gives you the positive only. 

Speaker 3 

No, I've been when I do the resume analysis, I ask it to be brutally honest because I'm trying to get a job, so that's. 

Speaker 2 

So. 

Speaker 3 

Tell me what the gaps are. And it usually is brutally honest. 

Speaker 2 

One thing that I like about this one is we can use that. And then we can go to LinkedIn and say. These are my gaps. Recommend me training courses. I pay for premium so I have access to the training thing. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, I signed up for that too, with the alumni discount. 

Speaker 2 

It's still like 40 bucks, 30, no, 20 bucks or whatever, but whatever. I'm going to take advantage. I'm looking for a job, so. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Hey, that reminds me. Do you are you getting GitHub pro for free? GitHub copilot pro for free? I am too, because I signed up for it and it says, oh, you qualify for free. I don't know why. I guess, you know, one thing is to be a maintainer of a popular open source repo. 

Speaker 2 

Not very. So far, yes so far. 

Speaker 3 

I can only think of type spec because I was a code owner for a while and contributor. 

Speaker 2 

It's funny you mentioned because I think montemagno because I was in the community standups. Yeah, that he didn't remove me because I was removed from the Azure maintainers and everything and I was removed from everything, right? I only have personal, but I guess being nice, he just decided to keep me. For the free one, because I did get charged for the $10 and two days later I got a refund saying no, no, you already have. 

Speaker 3 

Same. Yeah, same. I think maybe. Have you made country? I guess it's not that important. I I'm just glad that we're getting the freebie. I was just curious how I qualify. 

Speaker 2 

Broke, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I mean if. Yep. 

Speaker 3 

All right. I think we have enough here to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

Get started. So we're going to. Like. 

Speaker 2 

Think about it, because I've already taken an extra half an hour of your time, but think about it, you have access to this thing. Just add whatever we're going to continue planning a little bit and then let's go straight into coding. 

Speaker 3 

So before we do that, so I'm going to take this transcript or recording, transcribe it and then use it to put together a PRD that you and I can can go through. 

Speaker 2 

Like I yeah. 

Speaker 3 

I'll put it as a matter of fact, I'll put. 

Speaker 

It. 

Speaker 3 

In Google Docs and we'll. 

Speaker 2 

No, let's start. 

Speaker 3 

And we'll review it, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

This is getting familiar. 

Speaker 3 

We'll review it, decide that it, make sure that it's like aligned with what we want, and then we'll use that for coding because I think you know, we're going to need the front end, but we're also going to need the back end that talks to Google's. API which I've not done right. So we need to define what the API should look like and. Anyway, we'll take care of all that, but. 

Speaker 2 

So I think. Let's just whenever we have a chance, just continue. I'm OK with this front plan so far. I think our next planning would be that just see instead of sharing this screen, we should go into you know API for Google. What can we do? How can we authenticate using Google. All of those tools? 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

To do the backside of it and then that's it. We start, like you said, the. Yeah. Anyway, I just want to learn something new. I haven't used compiler for mobile app and I think it should be fairly good. It'll get us there. So OK, sounds good. 

Speaker 1 

All right. 

Speaker 3 

OK. All right, I'll talk to you later. 

Speaker 2 

Thank you so much my friend. All right. Take care. Bye. 

Speaker 4 

Aye.
